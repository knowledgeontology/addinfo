### The sequences of the Gilliamella-like bacterial 16S rDNA sequences, alignments and Blastn search results


Different partial 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained with a high similarity to that of Gilliamella sp. and shown below in fasta formats. Note: Lab1, my own lab, two sequences were obtained from fly surface and guts, respectively. Lab2, Dr. Erjun Lingâ€™s lab at our Institute. CFDRT, Core Facility of Drosophila Resource and Technology from the Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
