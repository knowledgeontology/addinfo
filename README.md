### The sequences of the Gilliamella-like bacterial 16S rDNA sequences, alignments and Blastn search results


Different partial 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained with a high similarity to that of Gilliamella sp. and shown below in fasta formats. 
###### Note: 
Lab1, Chengshu Wang's lab, two sequences were obtained from fly surface and guts, respectively.   
Lab2, Dr. Erjun Ling’s lab at our Institute. CFDRT, Core Facility of Drosophila Resource and Technology from the Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
